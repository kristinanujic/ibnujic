
A few more words about HYDRO_AS-2D
==================================

HYDRO_AS-2D originates from a model called FLOODSIM which I have developed 
during my research work at the Federal Armed Forces Univ. in Munich as the main part of my 
doctoral thesis.

HYDRO_AS-2D is in fact a further development and optimisation of algorithms / methods 
implemented in the model FLOODSIM.

FLOODSIM has been validated in an objective and neutral way within a framework of the
European project called CADAM (Concerted Action on DAm - Break modelling).

Objective and neutral way means the modellers did not know anything about results of measurements. 
They just got a data needed for performing runs with their models like: geometry, topography, 
boundary conditions applied, positions of gauges, etc. After performing modelling, modellers sent 
their results to organiser who performed comparison with the measurements. Afterwards the results 
were presented by organiser at the conference meeting.

More information on this project can be found in the internet (see the address below).
